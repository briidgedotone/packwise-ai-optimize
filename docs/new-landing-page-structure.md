## How It Works Section

### Section Headline
**All-in-one tools, each built for a different job**

### Subtext
QuantiPackAI isn't one-size-fits-all. Each application works differently to give you exactly what you need—from analytics to planning to design checks.

### Tool Cards (3-step visual flow)

#### Step 1: Suite Analyzer
**Visual:** Screenshot of Suite Analyzer interface
**Description:** Upload your order history and packaging list, and the AI finds your optimal packaging mix, forecasting cost and sustainability savings you can actually measure. It also compares your current packaging mix to a baseline, highlighting gaps and inefficiencies, and recommends improved packaging dimensions to increase fill rates so you can see exactly where to improve and how to pack out more effectively.

#### Step 2: Demand Planner
**Visual:** Screenshot of Demand Planner interface
**Description:** Feed in usage data or forecasts (by quantity or percentage). The AI tracks trends, updates demand plans in real time, and helps you order the right packaging at the right time.

#### Step 3: Spec Generator
**Visual:** Screenshot of Spec Generator interface
**Description:** Simply enter product names or short descriptions. The tool generates estimated product dimensions and volume, along with a note explaining the logic it used, so you can plan packaging more accurately and clean up incomplete data.

#### Step 4: Design Analyzer
**Visual:** Screenshot of Design Analyzer interface
**Description:** Upload artwork, dielines, or competitor packaging. The AI grades your design, highlights strengths and weaknesses, and compares it against competitors or alternative concepts so you can make sure your packaging stands out on the shelf.

#### Step 5: Packaging AI Chatbot
**Visual:** Screenshot of Chatbot interface
**Description:** Ask questions about the platform or packaging best practices. It's your on-demand expert for quick answers and training support.
