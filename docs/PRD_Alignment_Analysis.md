## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Backend Development**
   - Set up API server (Node.js/Python)
   - Implement database schema
   - Create file upload/storage system
   - Build authentication system

2. **Core Algorithm Implementation**
   - Develop CUIN calculation logic
   - Build packaging optimization algorithms
   - Create fill rate and efficiency calculators
   - Implement cost/savings analysis

3. **AI Integration**
   - Integrate GPT API for Spec Generator
   - Implement image analysis for PDP Analyzer
   - Build recommendation engines

4. **Data Processing**
   - CSV/Excel parsing libraries
   - Data validation and cleaning
   - Report generation system
   - Export functionality

### Current State Assessment
The application currently exists as a **UI prototype** with excellent visual design and user experience, but lacks all backend functionality and core business logic required by the PRD. It's essentially a frontend shell waiting for the actual packaging analysis engine to be implemented.
