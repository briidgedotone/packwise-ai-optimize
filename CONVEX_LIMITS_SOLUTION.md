# üö® Convex Free Plan Limits Exceeded - Solution Guide

## Current Status
Your Convex deployment has been **completely disabled** due to exceeding free plan limits. When this happens:

- ‚ùå **All queries fail** (dashboard, reports, etc.)
- ‚ùå **All mutations fail** (cannot save or delete data)
- ‚ùå **Cannot clean up data programmatically** (cleanup functions don't work)
- ‚ùå **Application features are offline** until limits are restored

## Why Cleanup Functions Don't Work

The catch-22 situation is:
- Need to delete data to restore backend ‚Üí Backend required to delete data
- Backend disabled due to too much data ‚Üí Cannot access backend to clean data

## Only Solution: Upgrade to Pro Plan

### Convex Pro Plan Benefits:
- **Cost**: $25/developer/month
- **Database storage**: 50 GB (vs 0.5 GB free)
- **Database bandwidth**: 50 GB/month (vs 1 GB free)
- **Immediate restoration** of all functionality

### How to Upgrade:
1. Visit [Convex Dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/t/quantipackai)
2. Click "Upgrade to Pro"
3. Complete billing setup
4. Backend functionality restores immediately

## Alternative Solutions (Not Recommended)

### 1. Create New Convex Project
- Start fresh with new project
- Lose all existing data
- Same limits will be hit again with heavy usage

### 2. Contact Convex Support
- Email: support@convex.dev
- May provide temporary relief
- Not guaranteed, and temporary only

## Preventing This in Future

After upgrading, implement these practices:

### Data Management:
- Regular cleanup of old analyses (monthly)
- Delete failed analyses immediately
- Use smaller test files during development
- Archive old data outside of Convex

### Monitoring:
- Monitor database size in Convex dashboard
- Set up alerts before hitting limits
- Clean up test data regularly
